# Crypto-App
## Final Project for Mobile App Projects COP 4655

### Description
Hello, welcome to my rough draft of "CryptoApp" (original, i know). It runs on android mobile devices, and is written in Java. You can use my application to browse coinmarketcap's api's top listings, and search for crypto price quotes, names, and symbols. Additionally, you can create a user account with firebase login, or login using your google account. In the future, you will be able to save your favorite currencies to your account, and view them at your leisure.



### Requirements
There are several ways to run CryptoApp, but I've made it easy but distributing my application through firebase. I've created a link: https://appdistribution.firebase.dev/i/e5480f609288dbad

specially made for those who view this project on GitHub. All you will need is a android mobile device, emulator, and a google account.

### Main Functionality
The functionality of this app is pretty brief, but serves as a testbed for which I plan to add on additional features. Currently, the main features available in CryptoApp are:

-Consumes Coinmarketcap's API 

-Search top cryptocurrency prices, names, and tickers

-Allow basic user sign-up/sign-in, using firebase and Google




### Testing
Here are some screenshots of CryptoApp at work:

Here's my landing page, where users can register and login

In the search activity, users can lookup their favorite cryptocurrencies prices, names, and tickers



### WORK IN PROGRESS

Ideally, users will be able to save a list of currencies here, and view their prices easily.
